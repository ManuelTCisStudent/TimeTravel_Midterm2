                        Through cinematic media, Science Fiction has served as the overall basis for many creative and
                        unique tales far from the typical tales within actual physics and logistics. Through Science
                        Fiction, multiple sub-genre came alive on the screen, and my favorite subject that came from the
                        realm of sci-fi is none other than Time Travel movies. As the name implies, time travel deal
                        with
                        the overall concept of what would happen if someone could go back to the past and change
                        sometime,
                        thusly changing their past, present, and future usually causing more harm than good. As such, my
                        love for the media came from the many differing story telling and differing styles of movies
                        allowed
                        leeway by employing time travel. Of course, Time Travel is a risky subject as many fall under
                        causing hazardous amount of plot holes to be developed within the story. However, even with
                        these
                        complexity, only the best can actually depict an complex, funny, or dramatic movie through
                        imposing
                        the complexity of time travel as a plot element. I'll be discussing a few of my favorite down
                        below.

                        <p>
                            Back to the Future serves as perhaps one of the biggest franchises to employ the core
                            theming
                            around time travel within it's main plot. Rather than be a movie taking part into showing
                            pure
                            misery and the nightmare fuel effects of brought upon by messing with the past, Back to the
                            Future (And its later two sequels) manages to showcase the danger brought in by time travel
                            in a
                            more friendly vibe, albeit still with serious consequences to keep the audience on their
                            toes.
                            Through this movie in particular came a more varied explosion of attempts to explore time
                            travel
                            from different studios, however nothing can beat a classic.

                        <p>
                            The Butterfly effect serves as a grim outlook into what would happen if good intention to
                            fix the past just leads into more misery. This cult classic film serves to bring out the
                            worst possible fate of those involved with time travel and serves as a cautionary tale
                            against the concept of changing the past. To that end, The Butterfly Effect is a film that
                            does a fine job at presenting its story and plot elements, while enticing the audince into
                            the false belief that salvation can be find if one simply changes the negetive past.

                            Noteworthy as perhaps one of the most confusing and thought provoking tale concerning about
                            time travel, Donnie Darko takes a more philosophical outlook onto our own existence through
                            time travel, while forcing us to confront what truely makes you as a person. While many have
                            written thesis videos/essays on the core story and implications of Donnie Darko, the overall
                            nature of the film leaves many wondering about the complexity behind an concept such as time
                            travel.
